To run the code living in SingleTop-tW:
(Summer12 53X release)

(there should be a /lib/ folder in the home, if it is not, 
mkdir ~/lib
will do)

//Check out the package
cvs co -r CMSSW_53X -d TopBrussels UserCode/TopBrussels
cd TopBrussels/TopTreeProducer
cd src

//Compile the TopTreeProducer (to define the strutures of the TopTrees and your objects)
make clean
make 

//Now go specifically to the Analysis and compile it (for tools like Selection)
cd ../../TopTreeAnalysis
make clean
make -j8 all

//Then create the folder for the outputs
mkdir SingleTop-tW/outputs

// And link it in the scripts
cd SingleTop-tW/scripts
ln -s ../outputs/ outputs

//Another folder inside scripts for the resulting rootfiles
mkdir results
cd -

//And compile the main code 
make macros/../SingleTop-tW/SingleToptW.exe

//Then go inside
cd SingleTop-tW/

//modify the .xml files to the right paths of the files, and that's it:

./SingleToptW.exe --emu

(everything should run directly)


To run in the background (best choice always):

nohup ./SingleToptW.exe --mumu > mumu.txt&

tail -f mumu.txt


Once all have run:

cd scripts
sh merge.sh

to run:

sh emu.csh

(all the final states run.csh)

mkdir plots
mkdor plots/pdf/

To do the plots:

root.exe plotmaker.C
